Divide data set in half, one half for training, other for testing
Test how many of the elements got the correct class
Start with 1%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, to 100% of training to train model
Create a graph to represent the accuracy
Depending on what labels you choose, you will get a different accuracy
Run over as many different training sets as possible of the same size
At least 10, 100 is ideal, average out accuracy
